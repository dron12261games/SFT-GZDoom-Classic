"Always Pistol Start" mod for GZDoom
by JP LeBreton

This simple ZScript mod makes it so you always "pistol start" every level. By
default in Doom, when you exit one level and enter another, you carry over
weapons, ammo, armor, and the backpack powerup. Pistol start means you start
every level with only your fists, the pistol, 50 bullets, 100 health, and no
armor.

This mod has been coded in such a way that it should work with a variety of
other mods, such as ones that modify the default player loadout and/or starting
health. Let me know if you find a mod this doesn't work with.

For your convenience, an on/off switch is provided in a new section of the
options menu. This way you can keep it auto-loaded (from gzdoom.ini) and turn it
on or off as needed.

Thanks to a fix from DevilBlackDeath, items marked UNDROPPABLE and UNTOSSABLE
are now handled correctly.
